CHANGELOG

Version 1.1.1
* fixed bug in MemoryTrace class so that it also works with two-dimensional
  inputs


Version 1.1
* added comments for command window help to Simulator, StandardGUI, and all 
  visualization and control classes
* changed base class of Element to matlab.mixin.Copyable to allow shallow copies
  of elements without requiring a copy function in each derived class
* added method copy to Simulator class that creates deep copy of simulator
* added method connect to StandardGUI class and additional optional parameter
  in method run, so that one StandardGUI instance can be run with different
  instances of a simulator
* added elements History, RunningHistory, WeightMatrix, and SingleNodeDynamics 
  (documentation), and added elements HalfWaveRectification and DynamicVariable
* added control PresetSelector (documentation)
* added visualizations XYPlot and SlicePlot (documentation), and SurfacePlot
* adjusted Simulator:fromStruct and Simulator:parametersFromStruct functions to
  be compatible with latest JSONlab version 0.9.1 (which changes certain 
  matrices to cell arrays when loading a file)
* adjusted Simulator:parametersFromStruct function so that it is possible to 
  load from a parameter file that does not fully match the architecture in the 
  simulator object (with warning indicating the non-matching elements)
* sligthly changed handling of parameter panel when GUI is closed; previously
  it could cause problems when starting the same GUI again, now parameter 
  panel is always closed when re-starting a GUI
* added support for pauseDuration of 0 in StandardGUI class
* in StandardGUI, introduced more reasonable handling of pause duration in each
  step while simulation is paused, by introducing separate property
  pauseDurationWhilePaused (otherwise wastes resources for very fast updating of
  plots when the value of pauseDuration is very small)
* added auxiliary function compareConfigFiles
* changed form of method calls from object.method(...) to method(object, ...) to
  improve performance, especially in older Matlab versions
* removed component input from NeuralField class to improve performance
